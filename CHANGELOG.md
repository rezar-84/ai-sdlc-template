# Changelog

This project follows semantic versioning. User-visible changes are recorded here.

## Unreleased

- Nothing yet.

## 2.5.0 — 2026-08-23

### Added

- Stack adapters for Node/TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby, Maven/Gradle, and .NET.
- ORM, database-driver, migration-tool, and testing-tool detection across those ecosystems.
- `--scaffold-tests` for an instantiated test plan and machine-readable testing profile.
- `--scaffold-ci github|gitlab` for opt-in pipelines generated from confirmed commands.
- Adapter and scaffolding fixtures covering supported language and database families.
- Polyglot command composition so every detected language participates in each quality stage.
- Manifest-managed template upgrades, allowing new testing and data-model guidance to
  reach existing installations without touching project records.

### Safety

- Scaffolding never installs dependencies and never overwrites existing test plans,
  profiles, or CI configuration.
- CI generation refuses repositories with no detected or confirmed quality commands.
- Generated CI is manual-only until a human confirms commands, runtimes, and services.
- Generated database guidance requires real-engine integration tests, migration/restore
  exercises, and synthetic test data.

## 2.4.0 — 2026-08-23

### Added

- Machine-readable manifests for portable managed files.
- Upgrade preflight checks, backups, obsolete-file cleanup, atomic writes, and rollback.
- Stack-neutral validation, continuous integration, and tag-based release automation.
- AI prompt-injection, secret-disclosure, and permission-escalation boundaries.
- Repository licensing, contribution guidance, and a security policy.
- Detection for integration, contract, accessibility, and common namespaced test scripts.

### Changed

- `--docs-dir` now updates the operating contract and Claude commands completely.
- Tier 3 uses a compact reading and worklog path.
- Dry runs and pre-confirmation quits no longer create target directories.
- Detected format, install, typecheck, and lint commands favor non-mutating,
  reproducible, locally installed tools.

## 2.3.0

- Added the navigable installer, localisation role, and architecture seeding.
