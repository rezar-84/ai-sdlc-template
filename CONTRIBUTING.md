# Contributing

Contributions should keep the kit portable, evidence-based, and usable without a runtime
dependency after installation.

## Before opening a change

1. Create a focused branch and explain the behavior being changed.
2. Keep project-specific policy out of `template/docs/process/` and
   `template/docs/roles/`.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under **Unreleased** for user-visible changes.
4. Add or update a smoke test for installer behavior.
5. Run:

   ```sh
   python3 validate.py
   python3 tests/smoke.py
   python3 -m py_compile install.py validate.py tests/smoke.py
   ```

## Compatibility

`install.py` uses only the Python standard library and supports Python 3.6 or newer.
Installed projects must not need Python or any dependency from this repository.

Do not add a stack-specific requirement to the portable process. Stack detection may
offer a verified default, but the guided review must allow a user to reject or edit it.

## Pull requests

Describe the risk, the compatibility impact, the test evidence, and any migration or
rollback concern. Changes to managed upgrade behavior need tests for clean upgrades,
locally modified files, obsolete files, and dry runs.
