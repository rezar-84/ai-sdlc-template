# Operating card — {{PROJECT_NAME}}

The whole standard, compressed. This replaces reading
[`process/02-role-reviews.md`](process/02-role-reviews.md),
[`process/04-quality-gates.md`](process/04-quality-gates.md),
[`process/06-evidence-and-claims.md`](process/06-evidence-and-claims.md), and
[`process/07-traceability.md`](process/07-traceability.md) for ordinary work.

**Open the full document when the card is not enough** — a contested severity, an
unusual evidence question, a traceability edge case, a review whose verdict is being
argued. **The full document wins on any conflict**; this card is a summary, not an
amendment.

## The loop

```
FRAME → PLAN → DESIGN REVIEW → BUILD → VERIFY → SHIP REVIEW → LOG → CLOSE
```

Depth scales with tier. Never skip LOG. An undocumented change is unfinished.

## Tiers

| Tier | Any one of | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | auth · authorisation · tenancy · payments · PII or regulated data · migration, deletion, or backfill · public brand/legal copy · infrastructure or release pipeline · a model/prompt/retrieval change on any of those, or in a system that acts · a contract others consume · anything hard to reverse | plan · role review · design + ship review · ADR · 2 human approvals · rollback plan |
| **2** | new feature or user-visible behaviour · schema addition · new dependency · refactor across boundaries · **any** prompt, model, retrieval, eval-threshold, or published-dataset change | plan · role review of touched surfaces · tests · worklog entry |
| **3** | copy/typo · patch bump · comment · formatting · adding a test · doc edit | one-line plan · no ship review · short worklog entry · no ADR |

Tier by **surface**, never by line count. A one-line change to an authorisation check —
or to a prompt governing one — is Tier 1. Splitting a Tier 1 item until no piece looks
Tier 1 violates the contract. When in doubt, tier up.

## Evidence — the seven words

Use exactly these. No synonyms. Not "should work", "looks right", "mostly passing".

| Word | Means |
| --- | --- |
| **Verified** | You ran it this session and read the output. |
| **Reported** | A tool, log, or person said so. Name the source. |
| **Assumed** | Proceeding on it, and it is in the assumptions register. |
| **Unknown** | You cannot establish it. A complete answer. |
| **Not run** | The check exists; you did not run it. Say why. |
| **Absent** | No such check exists here. A finding for the owning role, not a neutral fact. |
| **Measured** | The result is a number, not a pass. Conditions below. |

**Measured** carries all five, or it is not a claim: **method · subject and its version ·
N · spread · date and environment**. A number with no baseline is not an improvement, it
is a number. One run of a non-deterministic system is a sample. Comparing two
measurements requires the same subject version, environment, and seed policy — change
the system or the measurement, never both.

**Never invent** a metric, date, benchmark, quote, credential, or citation. Missing fact
→ write `_(unverified — needs confirmation: <what, from whom>)_` and log it in
`project/assumptions-and-risks.md`.

---

## Checks

Run in this order; take the commands verbatim from `project/charter.md` → Commands.

```
format → lint → typecheck → [infra] → unit → integration → [data] → contract →
[eval] → build → scan → a11y → e2e → [perf]
```

Bracketed stages exist only where the project has that surface. **Absent** if the charter
names no command; **Not run** with a reason if you skipped it. Neither is assumed to pass.
`[eval]` and `[perf]` report **Measured**, never "passed". An `[infra]` plan showing a
destroy, replacement, or permission widening goes to a named human before it is applied.
A `[data]` failure stops the pipeline; it never publishes and warns.

Tier 1 and 2 run everything. Tier 3 runs what can plausibly be affected and reports the
rest **Not run — Tier 3, no code path affected**.

Never disable, skip, or loosen a check to make a change pass. A flaky test is a defect
with a measured failure rate — characterise it, do not re-run until green.

## Severity and verdict

| Sev | Means | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **S0** | Irreversible or unbounded harm: data loss, breach or credential leak, one user's data reachable by another, total unavailability, unlawful handling of special-category data, a report that makes every other report untrustworthy. | Stop. Incident process. |
| **S1** | Serious harm, no workaround: a core journey unusable; an S0-kind defect not yet fired (injectable query, reachable known-vulnerable dependency, never-executed recovery path); legal exposure. | Release blocker. |
| **S2** | Real harm, poor workaround: important function degraded, a misleading claim shown to users, an a11y barrier on a still-usable surface. | Blocker unless a named human waives it in writing with a tracked follow-up. |
| **S3** | Localised defect, or a `project/` document that has drifted. | Scheduled fix. |
| **S4** | Cosmetic. | Backlog. |

**S0 vs S1** is not "did it happen yet" — it is whether anything stands between the
defect and the harm. **S2 vs S1** is "poor workaround" vs "no workaround".

| Verdict | When |
| --- | --- |
| **Pass** | Nothing, or only S4. |
| **Pass with conditions** | Worst is S3 — each becomes a backlog item with an ID and owner *before merge*. |
| **Block** | Any S0, S1, or S2. |

A role rates; **the ladder decides the verdict**. **You may not waive your own blocker** —
that needs a named human, a written reason, and a tracked follow-up. Noting a real problem
politely and continuing is worse than not reviewing: it launders the problem into a
document that looks like diligence.

A review that finds nothing must say what it checked and how, and what it did **not**
cover.

---

## Traceability

`{{PREFIX}}-###`. Sequential, never reused, never renumbered, permanent once it appears.
**Next ID** = highest number anywhere under `project/` — including `Dropped` rows, the
worklog archive, and review filenames — plus one, *not* the last row of the active table.
Work that shipped without one gets it retroactively, noted as retroactive.

| Record | File | Grows by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backlog | `project/backlog.md` | new rows, status edits |
| Worklog | `project/worklog.md` | append only, newest first |
| Decisions | `project/adr/NNNN-*.md` | new files; superseded, never edited |
| Reviews | `project/reviews/{{PREFIX}}-###-<stage>.md` | new files (Tier 1 only) |

Backlog row, positional: `| ID | Task | Tier | Owner role | Depends on | Status |`

Status: `Ready` · `Blocked` (never started) · `In progress` · `In review` (includes
holding a Block) · `Parked` (waiting on a named human) · `Done` (worklog entry exists) ·
`Deferred` · `Dropped`.

**Keep the backlog terse — narrative goes in the worklog.** This is the most-broken
formatting rule in the kit.

Review records: Tier 1 → a file per review. Tier 2 → the worklog entry's Reviews section.
Tier 3 → one line there.

agent tool, it is the routing.
