description: Check this project's SDLC documents for gaps, staleness, and drift
argument-hint: "[optional: charter | roles | staleness | traceability | profile]"

Audit the installed kit in this repository and report what is wrong with it. Scoped to:

$ARGUMENTS

(If no argument is given, run every section below.)

This command **reports**; it does not fix. Findings become backlog items, and the ones
that need a human decision — an unticked role, a missing approver — stay with the human.

## 1. Substitution

```sh
grep -rn '[{][{]' {{DOCS_DIR}} AGENTS.md .claude 2>/dev/null
```

(The character class is deliberate — a literal double brace in this file would itself be
substituted at install time.)

Any hit is a broken install: an unsubstituted work-item prefix leaves a literal path in
the docs an agent follows. Report every occurrence with its file.

## 2. Is anything pointing at the contract?

Nothing in this kit runs unless an agent is told to read `AGENTS.md`, and every tool
looks in a different file. Check that at least one of these names it:

```sh
grep -ln 'AGENTS.md' CLAUDE.md GEMINI.md AGENT.md CONVENTIONS.md \
  .github/copilot-instructions.md .cursor/rules/*.mdc .windsurfrules .clinerules 2>/dev/null
```

No output is a **finding of the highest severity in this report**: the documents are
installed, the process is not running, and nothing about the repository looks wrong. The
fix is one line — `Read and follow \`AGENTS.md\` in this directory.` — in whichever file
the tool in use actually loads. `.ai-sdlc/profile.json` → `harnesses` records what the
installer wired; a file listed there that no longer mentions `AGENTS.md` was edited since.

Codex, Jules, Zed, Factory and opencode read `AGENTS.md` directly and need no pointer.

## 3. Charter completeness

Read `{{DOCS_DIR}}/project/charter.md`. A blank cell is **Unknown**, not "not applicable"
(`{{DOCS_DIR}}/process/06-evidence-and-claims.md`), and an agent that guesses a check
command because the charter was blank produces confidently false "verified" claims.
Report, in this order of severity:

- Blank rows in **Commands** — each one is a stage that cannot be run or reported.
  Distinguish blank (nobody filled it in) from the word "absent" (deliberate).
- Blank **approvers**, **default branch**, or **staleness window**.
- Blank cells in **Model & data** or **Budgets** where the corresponding role is ticked.
- **Unticked roles with an empty reason column.** A blank reason means nobody decided;
  it does not mean the role does not apply. List each one as a question for a human.
- Ticked roles whose owned artifacts do not exist (see `{{DOCS_DIR}}/README.md` → the
  "Create when" column, which is the only statement of which artifacts this project is
  supposed to have).

## 4. Staleness

For every file in `{{DOCS_DIR}}/project/`, read the frontmatter `last-reviewed` and
compare against today and the charter's staleness window. Report anything older, anything
with a missing or malformed date, and anything marked `status: stale` that has no backlog
item to fix it. ADRs are exempt: they are dated records and are superseded, not refreshed.

## 5. Traceability

Per `{{DOCS_DIR}}/process/07-traceability.md`:

- Backlog rows in a done state with no worklog entry carrying that ID.
- Worklog entries whose ID is not in the backlog.
- Items marked `Parked` with no stated blocker or owner.
- Branches or recent commits referencing an ID that exists in neither.

## 6. Worklog size

Report the line count of `{{DOCS_DIR}}/project/worklog.md`. Past the rotation threshold in
`07-traceability.md`, recommend rotating the closed entries into
`{{DOCS_DIR}}/project/worklog-archive/`. An unbounded worklog quietly becomes the largest
file every future agent reads.

## 7. Profile drift

If `.ai-sdlc/profile.json` exists, compare its `commands`, `roles`, and `docs_dir`
against the charter. **The charter is the source of truth**; report any difference as
drift to be corrected in the profile, never the other way round. Report a `kit_version`
older than `.ai-sdlc/manifest.json` as an incomplete upgrade.

## 8. Refresh the status page

If `{{DOCS_DIR}}/dashboard.html` exists, rewrite `{{DOCS_DIR}}/dashboard-state.js` from
what you just read, keeping the shape that is already in the file: `generated` (today),
`project`, `prefix`, `kit_version`, `docs_dir`, `profile`, `wired`, `staleness_days`, and
the arrays `roles` (`name` · `active` · `reason`), `commands` (`stage` · `command`),
`items` (`id` · `task` · `tier` · `owner` · `depends` · `status`), `artifacts` (`file` ·
`status` · `owner` · `last_reviewed`), and `budgets`.

It is a generated project record, not a kit file — overwrite it whole rather than editing
around the edges, and set `generated` to today so the page stops declaring itself stale.
Never write a value you did not read from a file: the page inherits this kit's evidence
rules, and a status page that states something nobody verified is the exact failure the
rest of these documents exist to prevent.

## Output

One table: area · finding · severity per `{{DOCS_DIR}}/process/04-quality-gates.md` ·
who can fix it. Then the two or three things worth doing first. If a section is clean,
say so explicitly — "no findings" is a result, and silence is not.
